### [Autonomous Adaptive Analytics: Safe Agents that Analyze, Execute, and Explain](./autonomous-adaptive-analytics/)

**Build autonomous AI agents that detect issues, write code, self-heal from errors, and deliver production-ready analysis.**

This post demonstrates building an end-to-end system where AI agents autonomously analyze news articles, write classification code, recover from errors, and generate reports-all without human intervention.

**What you'll learn:**
- 🤖 Autonomous coding agents using Claude Code SDK
- 🏗️ Secure, isolated execution in Daytona sandboxes
- ⚡ Self-healing error recovery without human intervention
- 📊 Complete analysis workflow from data exploration to final reports

### [Context Is Not a Storage Unit: The Artifact Pattern for Scalable AI Agents](./context_is_not_a_storage_unit/)

**Achieve 99% token reduction and 99.2% cost savings while processing 50,000+ records with AI agents.**

This post reveals the critical architectural pattern for building production-ready AI agents that handle massive datasets. Learn why treating context as storage kills most deployments and how the artifact pattern enables scalable, cost-efficient agent systems.

**What you'll learn:**
- 🏗️ The Sample + Artifact pattern for data-intensive AI agents
- 💰 Proven 99%+ token and cost reduction with zero accuracy loss
- 🔒 Privacy-preserving architecture for sensitive data
- 🚀 MCP-based design for composable agent systems
