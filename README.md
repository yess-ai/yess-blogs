### [Autonomous Adaptive Analytics: Safe Agents that Analyze, Execute, and Explain](./autonomous-adaptive-analytics/)

**Build autonomous AI agents that detect issues, write code, self-heal from errors, and deliver production-ready analysis.**

This post demonstrates building an end-to-end system where AI agents autonomously analyze news articles, write classification code, recover from errors, and generate reports-all without human intervention.

**What you'll learn:**
- 🤖 Autonomous coding agents using Claude Code SDK
- 🏗️ Secure, isolated execution in Daytona sandboxes
- ⚡ Self-healing error recovery without human intervention
- 📊 Complete analysis workflow from data exploration to final reports

### [Context Is Not a Storage Unit: The Artifact Pattern for Scalable AI Agents](./context_is_not_a_storage_unit/)

**Achieve 99% token reduction and 99.2% cost savings while processing 50,000+ records with AI agents.**

This post reveals the critical architectural pattern for building production-ready AI agents that handle massive datasets. Learn why treating context as storage kills most deployments and how the artifact pattern enables scalable, cost-efficient agent systems.

**What you'll learn:**
- 🏗️ The Sample + Artifact pattern for data-intensive AI agents
- 💰 Proven 99%+ token and cost reduction with zero accuracy loss
- 🔒 Privacy-preserving architecture for sensitive data
- 🚀 MCP-based design for composable agent systems

### [Building Reliable Multi-Agent Workflows: Durable Execution with Validation Gates](./durable-agentic-workflows/)

**Transform fragile 45-minute workflows into resilient pipelines with checkpointing, validation gates, and smart recovery.**

This post shows how to build production-ready multi-agent workflows that survive infrastructure failures, catch AI hallucinations early, and optimize execution through task decomposition. Learn the exact patterns we use at Yess to process enterprise CRM data reliably.

**What you'll learn:**
- 🔄 Durable execution with automatic checkpointing and recovery
- ✅ Validation gates to catch AI errors before they cascade
- ⚡ Parallel optimization for independent workflow steps
- 🏗️ Production patterns using Temporal and Agno AI
