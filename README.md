### [Autonomous Adaptive Analytics: Safe Agents that Analyze, Execute, and Explain](./autonomous-adaptive-analytics/)

**Build autonomous AI agents that detect issues, write code, self-heal from errors, and deliver production-ready analysis.**

This post demonstrates building an end-to-end system where AI agents autonomously analyze news articles, write classification code, recover from errors, and generate reports—all without human intervention.

**What you'll learn:**
- 🤖 Autonomous coding agents using Claude Code SDK
- 🏗️ Secure, isolated execution in Daytona sandboxes
- ⚡ Self-healing error recovery without human intervention
- 📊 Complete analysis workflow from data exploration to final reports
